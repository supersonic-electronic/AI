**Answer:** No

## Q9: Do you need enhanced search capabilities in `src/frontend/api/search.py` to filter concepts by complexity level, domain, or prerequisite relationships?
**Answer:** Yes

## Q10: Should the concept visualization in the web app display enhanced metadata directly on the graph nodes (tooltips, badges) rather than only in the details panel?
**Answer:** Yes (tooltip)
