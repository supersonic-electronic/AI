# Initial Feature Request

**Date:** 2025-01-16 14:42  
**Feature ID:** enhanced-graph-metadata

## User Request

Add enhanced functionality to the graph database and web app that can provide descriptions, metadata, and mathematical formulas (via latex ideally or anything else that's appropriate for web display) attached to key concepts. Those enhanced data points should be visualized in the web app. Some of this may already been done.

## Key Elements Identified
- Enhanced functionality for graph database
- Web app integration  
- Descriptions and metadata for concepts
- Mathematical formulas (LaTeX preferred)
- Web-appropriate display format
- Visualization in web app
- Possibility some work already exists

## Initial Assessment
This appears to be an enhancement to an existing knowledge graph system that needs richer metadata capabilities and mathematical formula support with proper web visualization.
