# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-07-16 11:39
**Request ID:** external-integration-enhancement

## User Request

External integration is not working properly. The concepts enrichment from external sources is not aligned with concept domains. Tooltip metadata fields should be enriched as well as there should be related nodes pulled from external sources such as DBPedia. This all should be integrated into existing web app. Also relationship data should be enriched and made more accurate.

## Context

This is a request to improve the external knowledge base integration system (DBpedia, Wikidata) in the existing AI Knowledge Graph web application. The user has identified several issues:

1. **Domain alignment**: External concept enrichment not matching the financial/mathematical domain
2. **Tooltip enrichment**: Metadata fields in tooltips need better external data integration  
3. **Related nodes**: Need to pull in related concepts from external sources
4. **Relationship accuracy**: External data should improve relationship accuracy
5. **Web app integration**: All improvements need to work in the existing visualization

## Initial Assessment

Based on previous conversation context, there is already a DBpedia integration system in place with:
- External ontology connectors (DBpedia, Wikidata)
- Graph API endpoints with enrichment support
- Frontend visualization with external source styling
- Tooltip system with metadata display

The issues appear to be related to:
- Concept matching and domain relevance
- Incomplete metadata enrichment
- Missing relationship enrichment
- Integration gaps in the web application
