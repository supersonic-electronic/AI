# Discovery Questions

## Q1: Should the external enrichment prioritize financial/mathematical domains over general concepts?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (the application focuses on financial mathematics, so domain-specific matches should be prioritized over generic concepts)

## Q2: Do you want related concepts from external sources to appear as new nodes in the graph visualization?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (expanding the graph with related concepts provides more comprehensive knowledge exploration)

## Q3: Should tooltip metadata include external properties like DBpedia categories and types?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (richer metadata improves user understanding and provides more context)

## Q4: Do you want relationship enrichment to create new edges between local and external concepts?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (connecting local concepts to external knowledge creates a unified graph)

## Q5: Should the system automatically filter out external matches that are clearly unrelated to finance/mathematics?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (preventing irrelevant matches like "Atari Portfolio" improves accuracy and user experience)
