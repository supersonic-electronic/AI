# Expert Detail Questions - Phase 4

## Q1: Should we implement a unified concept normalization function that all systems (cache, extraction, enrichment) use consistently?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains architectural consistency and prevents the root cause of most inconsistencies)

## Q2: Should cache keys include normalized concept variants to ensure acronyms like "CAPM" and "capm" share the same cache entry?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (prevents duplicate cache entries for the same conceptual entity)

## Q3: Should we add cache validation and repair mechanisms that can detect and fix inconsistent enrichment data?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (provides automatic healing of existing inconsistencies)

## Q4: Should enrichment failures be logged with detailed debugging information to track when and why concepts fail to get enriched?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (essential for monitoring and troubleshooting enrichment quality)

## Q5: Should we implement a cache warming strategy that pre-enriches known financial concepts during system startup?
**Default if unknown:** No (may not be necessary if normalization fixes solve the core problem)
