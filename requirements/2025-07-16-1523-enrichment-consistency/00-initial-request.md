# Initial Request

**Timestamp:** 2025-07-16 15:23
**User Request:** Seems that there is a problem with consistent enrichment across all nodes. Investigate and provide robust fix.

## Context
The user has identified that enrichment is not being applied consistently across all nodes in the knowledge graph system. This appears to be a quality/reliability issue where some nodes receive external enrichment (DBpedia, Wikidata) while others do not, potentially affecting the overall user experience and data completeness.

## Request Type
- Investigation and Fix
- System Quality Issue
- Data Consistency Problem
