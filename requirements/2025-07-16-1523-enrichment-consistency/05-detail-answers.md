# Expert Detail Answers - Phase 4

## Q1: Should we implement a unified concept normalization function that all systems (cache, extraction, enrichment) use consistently?
**Answer:** Yes

## Q2: Should cache keys include normalized concept variants to ensure acronyms like "CAPM" and "capm" share the same cache entry?
**Answer:** Yes

## Q3: Should we add cache validation and repair mechanisms that can detect and fix inconsistent enrichment data?
**Answer:** Yes

## Q4: Should enrichment failures be logged with detailed debugging information to track when and why concepts fail to get enriched?
**Answer:** Yes

## Q5: Should we implement a cache warming strategy that pre-enriches known financial concepts during system startup?
**Answer:** No

## Implementation Consensus:
- Unified normalization function is approved for consistent behavior across all systems
- Normalized cache keys will eliminate duplicate entries for concept variants
- Cache validation and repair mechanisms will automatically heal inconsistencies
- Enhanced logging will provide visibility into enrichment failures
- Cache warming is not needed if normalization fixes solve the core issues
