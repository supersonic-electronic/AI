# Initial Requirements Request

**Date:** 2025-07-16 20:03  
**Request:** add epub format to the list of ingestion functionalities (to transform into text).

## User's Original Request
The user wants to extend the existing document ingestion system to support EPUB format files, converting them to text format for further processing.

## Context
This appears to be an enhancement to an existing document processing pipeline that currently handles other formats (likely PDF based on the codebase structure observed).
