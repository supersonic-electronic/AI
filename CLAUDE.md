## Project Overview

This is a research repository focused on portfolio optimization and quantitative finance, specifically covering:
- Investment Portfolio Optimization
- Mean-Variance Optimization
- Mean-CVaR Optimization
- Contribution to Analytical Risk
- Markowitz Optimization

## Repository Structure

- `portfolio_optimization/` - Contains research papers and extracted text files covering various portfolio optimization topics
- `Gemini.md` - Project documentation describing research methodology and topics

## Research Methodology

The project follows these research guidelines:
- Preference for academic (peer-reviewed) papers
- Preference for white papers and research from top investment firms
- Research files are saved in the project folder as both PDF and extracted text formats

## File Organization

Research materials are stored in paired formats:
- PDF files for original academic papers and books
- Corresponding `.txt` files with extracted text content for easier analysis

Key research areas covered include:
- Black-Litterman model intuition and implementation
- Risk parity and budgeting approaches
- Robust portfolio optimization techniques
- Mean-variance theory and CAPM applications
- Factor investing and systematic approaches

## Working with Research Materials

When working with this repository, note that:
- This is primarily a research collection rather than a code repository
- No build tools, package managers, or development commands are present
- The focus is on academic literature review and analysis
- Text extraction files (.txt) provide searchable content from PDFs
