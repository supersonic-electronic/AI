# Code Quality and Maintenance Commands

## Security Hardening

```bash
claude code "Implement comprehensive security measures:

1. Add input validation and sanitization for all inputs
2. Implement JWT-based authentication and RBAC
3. Add rate limiting and CORS policies
4. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
5. Integrate with secret management (Vault/AWS Secrets)
6. Add security monitoring and audit trails
7. Implement GDPR compliance features
8. Add dependency security scanning

Follow security best practices and include security testing."
```

## Monitoring and Observability

```bash
claude code "Add comprehensive monitoring and observability:

1. Implement structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
2. Add Prometheus metrics for key operations
3. Integrate OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
4. Create health check endpoints for all services
5. Set up alerting for failures and performance issues
6. Create Grafana dashboards for system metrics
7. Add APM for performance monitoring
8. Include log aggregation and centralized logging

Ensure minimal performance impact from monitoring overhead."
```

## Performance Optimization

```bash
claude code "Optimize system performance and scalability:

1. Add Redis caching for expensive operations
2. Implement document fingerprinting to avoid reprocessing
3. Add incremental processing for large collections
4. Optimize memory usage for large PDF processing
5. Implement smart batching for API calls
6. Add database connection pooling
7. Create async connection management
8. Add performance profiling and benchmarks

Include before/after performance comparisons."
```

## Documentation Enhancement

```bash
claude code "Create comprehensive documentation:

1. Add API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
2. Create developer setup guide with troubleshooting
3. Add architecture decision records (ADRs)
4. Create user guides for different personas
5. Add code examples and tutorials
6. Document mathematical algorithms and implementations
7. Create deployment and operations guides
8. Add troubleshooting and FAQ sections

Use clear, actionable language with examples."
```

## Deployment and DevOps

```bash
claude code "Create deployment and DevOps infrastructure:

1. Add Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
2. Create docker-compose for local development
3. Implement Kubernetes deployment manifests
4. Add environment-specific configuration management
5. Create database migration system
6. Add CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
7. Implement automated testing and deployment
8. Add infrastructure as code (Terraform/CloudFormation)

Include staging and production environment configurations."
```

## Code Quality Tools

```bash
claude code "Set up comprehensive code quality tooling:

1. Configure pre-commit hooks with all quality tools
2. Add mypy for static type checking
3. Implement automated security scanning with bandit
4. Add code complexity analysis and debt tracking
5. Set up automated dependency updates
6. Add license compliance checking
7. Implement code review automation
8. Add quality gates in CI/CD pipeline

Ensure tools integrate well with existing development workflow."
