# Discovery Questions - Phase 2

Based on analysis of the codebase, these are the five most important yes/no questions to understand the requirements for the graphical web-based frontend:

## Q1: Will users need to interact with the graph visualization in real-time (drag nodes, zoom, filter)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (interactive graph visualization is essential for data exploration)

**Why this default makes sense:** The request specifically mentions "interactively analyzing" the graph database, suggesting users need dynamic manipulation capabilities for effective analysis.

## Q2: Should the frontend display both concept details and document source information when nodes are selected?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (detailed information enhances analysis capabilities)

**Why this default makes sense:** The system has rich metadata including source documents, frequency counts, and relationships that would be valuable for analysis.

## Q3: Will this be a standalone web application or integrated into an existing web framework?
**Default if unknown:** Standalone (create new web application)

**Why this default makes sense:** The current codebase is primarily CLI-based Python with no existing web framework, suggesting a new standalone frontend is needed.

## Q4: Should the frontend include search and filtering capabilities to find specific concepts or relationships?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (search functionality is crucial for large knowledge graphs)

**Why this default makes sense:** With 20+ concepts and 262 relationships in the current dataset, and potential for much larger datasets, search/filter capabilities would be essential.

## Q5: Will the frontend need to handle live updates when new documents are processed through the CLI pipeline?
**Default if unknown:** No (static visualization of current data)

**Why this default makes sense:** The current system is batch-oriented CLI processing, and implementing real-time updates would require significant additional infrastructure complexity.
